### Hi there I'm Zahyr :lemon:
I'm a curious person who enjoys figuring out the building blocks of the world, and rearranging them to build something even better. My career is developing software, but my life is adventuring. Currently I am building infrastructure and real-time systems at Marel Meats, and love reading a good sci-fi book in my free time.
